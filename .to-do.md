IMPORTANT:

- Make the deck list contents change based on the URL which derives from the router-links. A child router-view element may need to be added.
- Any `for` loops that look for only one thing then call a break should be replaced with the simpler `.find()` method.
- Dynamically load cards' data and images from Scryfall.
- Upgrade Vue 2 to Vue 3.
- Indicate deck's mana colors.
- Add "Duplicate Deck" button to deck footer.
- Scroll tabs on horizontal overflow.
- Remove any special characters from URLs based on deck names.
- Add disappearing pop-up messages that say when a card has been added or removed.
- Stylize mana symbols.
- See for popular deck lists: https://magic.gg/decklists


UNIMPORTANT:

- Organize deck lists into subsections by card type.
- Add deck's average converted mana cost.
- Automatically sort deck page tabs by last edited date.
