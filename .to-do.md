MORE IMPORTANT:

- Add a link "by Iristorm Design" beside the site title in the site header.
- On the home page, when the illustration is clicked (which isn't a link or a button), make the Open Deck button flash for attention.
- Optimize home page illustration image.
- When going to the Contact page on Firefox, there's a brief white flash of the page. Might be a router-related issue.
- Add loading screen.
- Scryfall HTTP concerns: https://scryfall.com/docs/api/http-concerns
- See for popular deck lists: https://magic.gg/decklists
- Add more description about this app, how it works (localStorage), why I built it, etc. below the welcome section.
- When finished, upload this app's files to GitHub.

LESS IMPORTANT:

- Use a better card mask SVG.
- Replace automatic saving with manual saving and adding a "Save deck" button.
- Add disappearing pop-up messages that say when a card has been added or removed.
- Upgrade Vue to version 3.
- Upgrade Vuex to version 4.
- Put the mana color symbols of each deck by each deck's name.
- Add options for exporting and importing decks (JSON files).
- Apply Scryfall API's autocomplete feature: https://scryfall.com/docs/api/cards/autocomplete
- Add more deck info such as percentages of colors, percentages of card types, and mana curve.
- For card quantities, make actual, separate increment/decrement buttons instead of browser-based input buttons.
- Make custom-designed dialog boxes instead of using browser alerts.
- Use better, custom-designed tooltips.
- Fix rare potential error: The Scryfall API's auto-correcting of searched card names can cause a card to be added to a deck that already has it listed. This is because the Scryfall-corrected name doesn't get checked on the client side.
- Add sideboard list.
