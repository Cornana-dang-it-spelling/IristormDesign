IMPORTANT:

- FIX: The checking of existing names, whether for decks or for cards, needs to ignore the difference between straight and curved apostrophes.
- FIX: If possible, when adding a random card, only valid cards for a deck should be chosen: no token cards, no plane cards, etc.
- Use clipPath to cut out the areas of card images outside the card's rounded corners. 
- It's possible Vuex state isn't needed for storing decks; maybe localStorage could be used directly.
- The app should detect whether localStorage is supported on the current browser, and if not, give a warning.
- Scroll tabs on horizontal overflow.
- See for popular deck lists: https://magic.gg/decklists
- Add a "Contact" section.
- Add more description about this app, how it works (localStorage), why I built it, etc. below the welcome section.
- On Axios requests, add a loading indicator and use `.finally` functions to end them.

UNIMPORTANT:

- Scryfall API error objects: https://scryfall.com/docs/api/errors
- By the sort cards option, a "Refresh" button should appear when a card is added or a card's quantity has changed.
- See about lazy-loading for Vue Router.
- Make the Add Card button/section flash occasionally while a deck has zero cards.
- Add disappearing pop-up messages that say when a card has been added or removed.
- Indicate deck's mana colors.
- Upgrade Vue version from 2 to 3.
- Organize deck lists into subsections by card type.
- Add deck's average converted mana cost.
- Put the mana color symbols of each deck by each deck's name.
- Automatically sort deck page tabs by last edited date.
- Add options for exporting and importing decks (JSON files).
- When a card is removed, make it appear to get overlapped by the next card instead of becoming suddenly invisible.
- Apply Scryfall API's autocomplete feature. (https://scryfall.com/docs/api/cards/autocomplete)
