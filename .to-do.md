IMPORTANT:

- Dynamically load cards' data and images from Scryfall.
- Vue 3 has finally been released; upgrade to it at the beginning of October and make any necessary changes.
- Whenever adding a new deck, the URL should change to that deck's name. *Vue Router* is probably needed to do this.
- Indicate deck's mana colors.
- Add "Duplicate Deck" button to deck footer.
- Scroll tabs on horizontal overflow.
- Remove any special characters from URLs based on deck names.
- Add disappearing pop-up messages that say when a card has been added or removed.
- Stylize mana symbols.
- See for popular deck lists: https://magic.gg/decklists


UNIMPORTANT:

- Organize deck lists into subsections by card type.
- Add deck's average converted mana cost.
- Automatically sort deck page tabs by last edited date.
