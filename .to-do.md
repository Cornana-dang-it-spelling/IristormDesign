IMPORTANT:

- Make animations.
- Dynamically load cards' data and images from Scryfall.
- Instead of a set default card, making the first shown card the last shown card from the last deck viewing.
- Probably need VueX.
- The common `deck` parameter in functions could probably use VueX instead.
- Fix: Increasing a card's quantity by adding a new card doesn't change the edit date. (Probably need VueX.)
- Fix: Increasing a card's quantity by adding a new card doesn't work on newly added cards.
- Vue 3 has finally been released; upgrade to it at the beginning of October and make any necessary changes.
- Deck-renaming operation should detect letter case differences and change the name accordingly.
- Fix: Deleting a deck shouldn't show a mostly blank page afterward.
- Fix: Deck header subsections aren't vertically aligned.


UNIMPORTANT:

- Organize deck lists into subsections by card type.
- BUG: When adding a card to a deck, if that card already exists in the deck, its quantity increases by 1. However, this happens even when the card's max quantity limit has been reached, which it shouldn't.
