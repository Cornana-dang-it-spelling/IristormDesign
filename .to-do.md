IMPORTANT:

- BUG: Increasing the quantity of newly added cards doesn't change the deck's count of total cards.
- Make animations.
- Dynamically load cards' data and images from Scryfall.
- Probably need VueX. The common `deck` parameter in functions could probably use VueX instead.
- Vue 3 has finally been released; upgrade to it at the beginning of October and make any necessary changes.
- Indicate deck's mana colors.
- Scroll tabs on horizontal overflow.
- Remove any special characters from URLs based on deck names.
- Add disappearing pop-up messages that say when a card has been added or removed.
- Stylize mana symbols.


UNIMPORTANT:

- Organize deck lists into subsections by card type.
- BUG: When adding a card to a deck, if that card already exists in the deck, its quantity increases by 1. However, this happens even when the card's max quantity limit has been reached, which it shouldn't.
- Add deck's average converted mana cost.
- Automatically sort deck page tabs by last edited date.
