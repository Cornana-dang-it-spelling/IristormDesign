- Organize deck lists into subsections by card type.
- Add to deck header the date of the last edit made.
- Make animations.
- Dynamically load cards' data and images from Scryfall.
- If a deck doesn't have a default card yet, make the first added card automatically assigned as the default.
- Don't use <form>s on changing deck footer elements.
- Fix: Renaming a deck needs to keep the deck's tab open.
- When adding a card that already exists in the deck, add 1 to the existing card's quantity instead.


UNIMPORTANT:

- When renaming, if a deck's name is saved as its old name, an error message appears. Instead in this case, it should be treated the same as canceling.
