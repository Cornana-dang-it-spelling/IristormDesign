- The "Page Not Found" page should be displayed while keeping the broken URL.

- Scroll tabs on horizontal overflow.
- Remove any special characters from URLs based on deck names.
- Add disappearing pop-up messages that say when a card has been added or removed.
- Stylize mana symbols.
- See for popular deck lists: https://magic.gg/decklists
- Names of single-instance components should be prefixed with `The`, such as `TheHeading.vue`. (https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Single-instance-component-names-strongly-recommended)


UNIMPORTANT:
