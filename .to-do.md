IMPORTANT:

- Make animations.
- Dynamically load cards' data and images from Scryfall.
- If a deck doesn't have a default card yet, make the first added card automatically assigned as the default.
- Fix: Setting default card has multiple issues including the "last edited" status not updating.
- Probably need VueX.
- Fix: Increasing a card's quantity by adding a new card doesn't change the edit date. (Probably need VueX.)
- Fix: Increasing a card's quantity by adding a new card doesn't work on newly added cards.
- For inputs, don't always use `v-model` if a synchronized input value isn't wanted.
- Vue 3 has finally been released; upgrade to it at the beginning of October and make any necessary changes.


UNIMPORTANT:

- Organize deck lists into subsections by card type.
- When renaming, if a deck's name is saved as its old name, an error message appears. Instead in this case, it should be treated the same as canceling.
- BUG: When adding a card to a deck, if that card already exists in the deck, its quantity increases by 1. However, this happens even when the card's max quantity limit has been reached, which it shouldn't.
